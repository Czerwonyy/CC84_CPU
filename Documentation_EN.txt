CC84 - CZERWONY CPU 8bit 4bit                                                                                                                |

The 8bit means that the CPU data bus is 8bit wide. The same goes for the 4bit, but insted of data bus its addres bus.                        |

The architecture of the CPU is SAP (SIMPLE AS POSIBLE) Designed by Ben Eater https://www.youtube.com/@BenEater/featured                      |

ALU-Arithmetic Logic Unit
MAR-Memory Addres Register

How to program cpu:
  First on the control panel the pin 8 is responsible for starting program, while the 7 pin is used to reset the cpu.

  To program the cpu (for now) you need change data in the rom modules of PC.
  The top one is responsible for operation (LOAD A, LOAD MAR etc.) while the botom one is used to send data into DATA BUS
  The data in operation rom is devided into 2 4bit parts. The bits from 0-3 are used for operation, and bits from 4-7 are used for memory addres.

                                                                  Operation      Memory addres
                                                                        \        /
                                                                        0010|0100

  Operations/microcodes:
  LOAD A - 0001 [1]| loads data from data bus into A register
  LOAD B - 0010 [2]| loads data from data bus into B register
  LOAD OP - 0011 [3]| loads 4 first bits from data bus into Operation register
  LOAD MAR - 0100XXXX [4]| loads data from ADDRES BUS into MAR, the XXXX is the addres of RAM in whitch you want to operate
  LOAD OU - 0101 [5]| loads data from ALU into OU REGISTER
  MEM IN - 0110 [6]| loads data from data bus into RAM
  MEM OU - 0111 [7]| outputs data from RAM into DATA BUS
  JMP - 1000 [8]| jump instruction for PC (eg. JUMP 0A)
  NONE - from 1001 to 1110 [9-E]| these are not connected to anythink, and you can use these for your modifications
  RESET - 1111 [F]| resets value of EVERY register into deafult value (0)
